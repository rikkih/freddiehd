This repo is going over the Django 4 tutorial and adding in some good development practices at the same time. It will eventually become a different site with a frontend and separate use case.

This is purely for learning the framework.

## TODO: Application
- Create forms for user input
- Create enriched views

## TODO: DevOps

- Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
- Add containerisation of isolated apps and services.
- Add GitHub Actions CD pipeline to carry out the next todo.
- Create Cloud infrastructure in a separate repo that this repo can deploy to.

## TODO: Testing

- Get 100% coverage on source code excluding third-party fluff.
- Add factories and mocks with `factory_boy` and `mock`, respectively.
- Fill out new `polls/tests/` directory with appropriate tests.
