# FreddieHD

This repo is going over the Django 4 tutorial and adding in some good development practices at the same time. It will eventually become a different site with a frontend and separate use case.

This is purely for learning the framework.

## TODO

- Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Add containerisation of isolated apps and services
- Add GitHub Actions CD pipeline to carry out the next todo
- Create Cloud infrastructure in a separate repo that this repo can deploy to
